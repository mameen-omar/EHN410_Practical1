 \subsubsection*{To run the ssl-\/server\+:}




\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Open the terminal.
\item Navigate to the server root directory.
\item Ensure that the certificate files are in the root directory of the server (or sub-\/directory of the server).
\item Run the command make server.
\item The server program will be compiled and the executable will be called \char`\"{}server\+Main\char`\"{}.
\item Run the server using the default parameters using the command ./server\+Main
\item Enter the P\+EM password (the default certificate and key password is\+: \textquotesingle{}password\textquotesingle{})
\item The server will now be active and running.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To automatically compile and run the server with default parameters, run the command make run-\/server
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item to view the server help menu run\+: ./server\+Main -\/h
\item to specify a port use the -\/p flag followed by the port on which you would like the server to listen. (example ./server\+Main -\/p 3559).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item If no hostname is specified with the port (-\/p hostname\+:port), the server by default listens on all available interfaces for an incoming connection.
\item the user is able to change the certificate and key files for the server as well. Please view the server help menu for further details.
\item The mime-\/types.\+tsv file in the server root directory is used to determine the mime-\/type to specify in the server response header. If this file is not in the root directory or the mime-\/type for a file is not in this file, the secure server will default to the \char`\"{}application/octet-\/stream\char`\"{} mime-\/type being specified and as such, will not notify the client what type of file is being sent.
\item The secure server adheres to the H\+T\+TP 1.\+1 standard and only caters for G\+ET requests from a client. Additional functionality was not required.
\end{DoxyItemize}



 \subsubsection*{To run a client in the terminal\+:}




\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Open the terminal.
\item Navigate to the client root directory.
\item Run the command make all.
\item The client program will be compiled and the resulting executable will be called \char`\"{}client\char`\"{}.
\item Run the client providing the -\/u command-\/line argument which should specify a path to a file on the server (eg. \mbox{[}host\mbox{]}\+:\mbox{[}port\mbox{]}/\mbox{[}filename\mbox{]}.\mbox{[}extension\mbox{]}).
\item An optional -\/n command-\/line argument can be defined which will specify how many instances of the client should be spawned.
\item The client will now run and the file that was specified will attempt to download.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A path to an existing file on an external web-\/server is defined within the makefile and can be run using the \textquotesingle{}make run\textquotesingle{} command.
\item Issuing the command \char`\"{}./client -\/-\/help\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}./client -\/h\char`\"{} will print a help menu and provide insight on the accepted command line arguments.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{An absolute path to a file must be specified including the file name and extension.}



 \subsubsection*{To access server files in a web browser\+:}




\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Install all the server certificates in the web browser to be used (e.\+g Firefox).
\item To do this, Go to the Certificate Manager in Firefox
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Click on Tools-\/$>$Options-\/$>$Advanced,
\item Click on the Encryption Tab and click on View Certificates,
\item Click on the Authorities tab and click Import, then
\item Select your created certificate and provide the necessary permissions.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Ensure that the server is running.
\item Navigate to the S\+SL server page in the browser\+: \href{https://hostname:port}{\tt https\+://hostname\+:port} (example\+: \href{https://localhost:40001/}{\tt https\+://localhost\+:40001/})
\item The homepage will load.
\item Click on the links provided.
\item Navigate to unlisted files to download files that are not added by default (example\+: \href{https://localhost:40001/resources/sample.mp3}{\tt https\+://localhost\+:40001/resources/sample.\+mp3})
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the certificate files are not installed before accessing the server webpage, the page will appear as \char`\"{}untrusted\char`\"{}, add as an exception, and continue to the server homepage.
